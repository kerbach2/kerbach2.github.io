Since finishing my PhD at Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf in June of 2019, I have been working as a Lecturer of English Linguistics at Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn. While teaching, I have expanded upon the work I began during my thesis by digging deeper into countability related questions in English, Greek, Hungarian, and Kurdish, looking into the acquisition of the mass/count distinction in English, and by expanding my empirical toolkit with corpus studies. I'm also interested in linguistic phylogeny and complexity and working towards including these in future projects.

In my PhD thesis, “[Object Mass Nouns: A Frame Based Analysis](https://docserv.uni-duesseldorf.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-59676/kurt%20erbach.thesis.pdf)”, I motivate the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the number of object mass nouns in a language and the number of morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in that language. My thesis investigates typologically distinct languages—Greek, Hungarian, and Japanese—for object mass nouns as a means of testing the adequacy of the leading theories of the mass/count distinction. This investigation reveals that a disjointness-based approach to the mass/count distinction (Landman 2011, 2016; Sutton & Filip 2016, 2017) allows for the most accurate crosslinguistic predictions. Furthermore, the respective amounts of object mass nouns and morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in Greek, Hungarian, and Japanese are relatively low when compared to those for English, and this comparison supports the hypothesis that there is a relationship between he number of object mass nouns in a language and the number of morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in that language.

My current research projects are listed below, as are my publications and courses.
