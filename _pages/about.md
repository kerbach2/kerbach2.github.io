In my PhD thesis, “Object Mass Nouns: A Frame Based Analysis”, I motivate the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the number of object mass nouns in a language and the number of morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in that language. Object mass nouns constitute a means to test theories of the mass/count distinction because they denote discrete objects but grammatically pattern with substance denoting nouns, therefore exhibiting misalignment of conceptual individuation and grammatically mass behavior (Chierchia 2010). Theories of the mass/count distinction typically focus on English, include data from a classifier language like Mandarin, and sometimes address one or two other languages as well (Chierchia 2015, Landman 2016, Rothstein 2017, Sutton & Filip 2017). Following crosslinguistic approach of Grimm (2012), my thesis investigates typologically distinct languages—Greek, Hungarian, and Japanese—for object mass nouns as a means of testing the adequacy of the leading theories of the mass/count distinction. This investigation reveals that a disjointness-based approach to the mass/count distinction (Landman 2011, 2016; Sutton & Filip 2016, 2017) allows for the most accurate crosslinguistic predictions. Furthermore, the respective numbers of object mass nouns and morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in Greek, Hungarian, and Japanese are relatively low when compared to those for English, and this comparison supports the hypothesis that there is a relationship between he number of object mass nouns in a language and the number of morphosyntactic environments sensitive to the countability of nouns in that language.
